# BrighterSide

## "Always Look at the Brighter Side"
Pressure and negativity can oftentimes cause us to overlook the positives events in our lives. I know I struggle with this a lot, so I'm building a tool that can help track and remind myself of all the good that has and continues to happen in life. Hope this can be of use to some of you all as well :]

## /dev/ Log
### Sept 19th 2020

Currently laying out initial architecture and framework of the project. Will be updating Wiki with frameworks as they happen, and bound to change a ton during these early stages. Initial name of this project is BrighterSide (as in "Always look at the brighter side"), and I'm excited to start soon :D
